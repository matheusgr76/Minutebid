---

## Session 2 — Discovery Refinement & Price Correction
- [x] FIX: Replace generic soccer tag discovery with league-specific IDs (EPL, La Liga, Serie A, etc.)
- [x] FIX: Use `clobTokenIds` (YES tokens) instead of `conditionIds` for CLOB API pricing

- [x] EXECUTE: Update `display.py` with "Betfair%" headers and "← BET" flag
- [x] VERIFY: Run `python main.py` during live window (verified connection and price resolution) ✅

---

## Session 3 — Hardening
- [x] Improve Polymarket ↔ Odds API event name matching (string fuzzy matching)
- [x] Add session logging to a `.log` file for overnight monitoring
- [x] Unit tests for `scanner.filter_opportunities()` with synthetic edge cases
- [x] Pivot to Gamma API `bestAsk` for market prices (replaces problematic CLOB API calls)
    - [x] Refactor `polymarket_client.py` to extraction prices from Gamma response
    - [x] Update `main.py` to remove redundant CLOB calls
- [x] Implement robust retry logic for Odds API and Gamma API calls

---

## Session 4 — Smart Bot Scheduling (Phase 5)
- [x] Create feature branch `feature/scheduling`
- [x] EXECUTE: `polymarket_client.get_soccer_schedule()`
- [x] EXECUTE: Refactor `main.py` into targeted `run_scan(event_ids)` function
- [x] EXECUTE: Create `scheduler.py` (Daily Discovery mode + 95m Wakeup Sleep loop)
- [x] VERIFY: Run discovery manually and check "95m Wakeup" logic
- [x] VERIFY: E2E test during a live window to confirm zero quota waste ✅

## Session 5 — Telegram Notifications (Phase 6)
- [x] EXECUTE: Create `telegram_client.py` using Bot API
- [x] EXECUTE: Update `.env` / `config.py` with Bot credentials (template added to `.env.example`)
- [x] EXECUTE: Connect `main.py` iteration results to Telegram alerts
- [x] EXECUTE: Add status heartbeats to `scheduler.py`

---

## Session 6 — Scanner Hardening (Phase 7)
- [x] EXECUTE: Install `rapidfuzz` for string metric matching
- [x] EXECUTE: Implement name normalization (lowercase, trim suffixes like "FC" or "United")
- [x] EXECUTE: Update `scanner.py` to use fuzzy thresholds (Token Set Ratio) when exact match fails
- [x] VERIFY: Run tests with a list of known variations (e.g., "Arsenal FC" vs "Arsenal") ✅
## Session 7 — Scheduler UI (Telegram Monitoring)
- [x] THINK: Design Telegram summary format with countdowns
- [x] EXECUTE: Update `telegram_client.py` with `update_scheduler_dashboard` (send/edit live dashboard with T-minus countdowns, 15-game cap)
- [x] EXECUTE: Update `scheduler.py` to call dashboard after discovery
- [x] FIX: Throttle `update_scheduler_dashboard` to 300s interval — dashboard is monitoring-only; alerts handle real-time opportunity delivery
- [x] VERIFY: Run scheduler and verify Telegram dashboard output and update cadence ✅
- [x] FIX: Deduplicate schedule entries by normalized title — Polymarket emits "Match X" and "Match X - More Markets" as separate events; strip known suffixes and check `seen_titles` to keep only the canonical entry

---

## Session 8 — Hotfix: Wakeup Delay & Stability
- [x] Create hotfix branch `hotfix/wakeup-and-stability` off `main`
- [x] EXECUTE: Reduce `WAKEUP_DELAY_MINUTES` to 80 in `scheduler.py`

- [x] EXECUTE: Simplify `scanner.py` to focus on bookmaker odds threshold instead of edge/prob ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: Update `main.py` to reflect the simplified scanning flow ✅
- [x] VERIFY: Run bot and verify 2-minute cadence and threshold detection ✅

---

## Session 10 — Dashboard Reliability (Phase 10)
- [x] Refactor `scheduler.py` to move dashboard update logic into a helper function. ✅
- [x] Inject the helper function into the active monitoring loop. ✅
- [x] Reduce `dashboard_interval` to 120s for better responsiveness. ✅
- [x] Verify that the dashboard updates while a match is "ACTIVE". ✅

---

- [x] EXECUTE: Create `Dockerfile` (python:3.12-slim, PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1) ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: Create `.dockerignore` ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: Update `todo.md` and `implementation_plan.md` ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: Merge `hotfix/telegram-dashboard-refactor` → `main` and push to GitHub ✅
- [x] VERIFY: Create Koyeb Worker service, set env vars, deploy, confirm "Smart Scheduler Started 🚀" via Telegram ✅

---

## Session 15 — Scanner Pivot: Polymarket-Only (Hotfix)
- [x] THINK: Root cause — `ODDS_API_SPORT = "soccer"` is invalid key + free tier has no live odds → scanner never fired ✅
- [x] THINK: Decision — drop Odds API entirely, alert on Polymarket price >= 80% during 75-90+ min ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: Simplify `scanner.py` to Polymarket-only (remove `reference_prices` param) ✅

- [x] VERIFY: Confirmed UEL matches appear in daily discovery dashboard ✅

---

## Session 16 — Fix: Drop Broken WebSocket, Use Time-Based Minute
- [x] THINK: Root cause — Sports WebSocket returns 0 events every scan; missing subscription message ✅
- [x] THINK: Decision — drop WebSocket, estimate minute from Gamma API `startTime` + elapsed time ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: Rewrite `scanner.py` — `_estimate_minute()` replaces `game_states` lookup ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: Remove `sports_ws` import/call from `main.py` ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: Remove score line from `telegram_client.py` alert, add `~` prefix to minute ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: Delete `sports_ws.py` ✅
- [x] VERIFY: Bet signal confirmed firing during live games ✅

---

## Session 16b — Fix: display.py Silent Crash on Bet Signal
- [x] THINK: Root cause — `display.print_results()` referenced stale fields (`reference_prob`, `resolved_outcome`, `score`) from pre-pivot era; crashed with `KeyError` on every real opportunity, killing Telegram alert before it sent ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: Update `display.py` print loop to use current fields (`outcome`, `poly_prob`) ✅
- [x] VERIFY: Telegram alerts confirmed firing end-to-end ✅

---

## Session 17 — Automatic Betting (Phase 17) ✅ LIVE
Branch `feature/automatic-betting` merged to `main` and deployed to Koyeb.

### Prerequisites
- [x] Signal quality validated — multiple live signals confirmed correct, manual execution too slow ✅
- [x] Polymarket account ready ✅
- [x] $14 USDC already on Polymarket (CLOB draws from proxy wallet — no transfer needed) ✅
- [x] CLOB API key + secret + passphrase generated in Polymarket UI ✅
- [x] Wallet private key exported from Crypto.com DeFi wallet ✅
- [x] All four CLOB credentials added to Koyeb env vars as Secrets ✅

### Architecture Design
- [x] THINK: Flat stake ($1/bet) chosen over Kelly — simpler, safer for initial trials ✅
- [x] THINK: RiskManager design — $5 budget cap/session, duplicate token guard ✅
- [x] THINK: FOK market orders chosen — immediate fill or cancel, no stale orders post-whistle ✅
- [x] THINK: Failure modes documented — token_id None, FOK no-fill, auth error, duplicate signal ✅

### Implementation
- [x] EXECUTE: `risk_manager.py` — session-scoped RiskManager, approve/record_bet ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: `trader.py` — `place_order(token_id, stake_usdc)` + `is_credentials_configured()` ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: `scanner.py` — added `token_id` (clobTokenIds[0]) to opportunity dict ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: `config.py` — `MAX_BET_BUDGET_USD=5.0`, `BET_STAKE_USD=1.0`, `CLOB_HOST`, `CLOB_CHAIN_ID` ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: `main.py` — `run_single_scan(risk_manager=None)`; alert-only when None ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: `scheduler.py` — creates fresh RiskManager at each session wakeup ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: `telegram_client.py` — `send_order_confirmation()` and `send_order_failure()` ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: `requirements.txt` — added `py-clob-client>=0.16.0` ✅
- [x] EXECUTE: `.env.example` — CLOB credential keys added, stale Odds API entry removed ✅

### Verification
- [x] Koyeb deployment healthy — "Smart Scheduler Started 🚀" and discovery confirmed ✅
- [ ] VERIFY: First live bet placed and confirmed on Polymarket — pending next signal
- [ ] VERIFY: Budget cap enforced — bot refuses to bet beyond $5/session

---

## Session 18 — Observability & Post-Bet Analysis (planned)
- [ ] THINK: Log per-bet record (token_id, stake, fill price, P&L) to a persistent file
- [ ] THINK: Session summary Telegram message after each game window closes
- [ ] THINK: Distinguish FOK-cancelled vs filled from order response `status` field
